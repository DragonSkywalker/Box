Current:
	Make drawing order of layers work

ToDo:
	Make Boxes not rely on gravity
	Make cursor be on the place where there would be a box
		idea: 
			give cursor collision (a smaller box in ceter)
			if collide with a box on the same layer, move it up a space
			and before moving the cursor, send it to ground level then move it
