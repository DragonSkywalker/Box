ToDo:
	1. name layer something else 
	2. Fix the new layer's x position 
	3. Make Boxes not rely on gravity
	4. Make drawing layers of box work
	5. Make cursor be on the place where there would be a box (vertical)
		idea: 
			give cursor collision (a smaller box in ceter)
			if collide with a box on the same layer, move it up a space
			and before moving the cursor, send it to ground level then move it
	
Whenever:
	Make cursor 3D
