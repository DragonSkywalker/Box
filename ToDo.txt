Current:
	Make drawing order of layers work

ToDo:
	Fix the new layer's x position 
	Make Boxes not rely on gravity
	Make cursor be on the place where there would be a box
		idea: 
			give cursor collision (a smaller box in ceter)
			if collide with a box on the same layer, move it up a space
			and before moving the cursor, send it to ground level then move it

	Make cursor 3D

	maybe name layer something else 
	since it can also mean drawing layer and collision layer
